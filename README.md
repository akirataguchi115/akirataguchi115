### Hi~~~! <3
I'm interested in copyleftism, free software and open source, in that order.

I write documentation, create issues and code small programs that are actually useful.

A few interesting projects I have on my sights:

- A Hacker Company - World's first copyleft software company
- Master's thesis - An agile approach to software license
- Global Discord GameSDK
- Steam alternative so good people will refer Steam as an alternative

GPG Key: I wish I had one

Generally you can find me on many places with my full name Akira Taguchi.

I also have a GitHub Sponsors page, but you are honestly much better off sponsoring other people working on great software projects.

<!-- and yes i literally downloaded 5k+ repositories on bare metal. on windows. my defender was angry. -->
