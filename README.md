I'm interested in strong copyleft, free software and open source, in that order.

I write documentation, create issues and code small programs that are actually useful.

A few interesting projects I have on my sights:

- Master's thesis - SLR on open source licenses in software engineering
- A Hacker Company - World's first copyleft software company
- Publishing my first O'Reilly technical book

GPG Key: `54A8 D3B9 3222 3204 9CFC 1591 3B2D 39B6 0BC1 A33D`

Generally you can find me on many places with my full name Akira Taguchi.

I also have a GitHub Sponsors page, but you are honestly much better off sponsoring other people working on great software projects.

<!-- and yes i literally downloaded 5k+ repositories on bare metal. on windows. my defender was angry. -->
