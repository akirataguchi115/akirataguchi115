I'm interested in copyleftism, free software and open source, in that order.

I write documentation, create issues and code small programs that are actually useful.

A few interesting projects I have on my sights:

- My company - World's first copyleft software company
- PhD - Focus on the academic aspect of free/libre software
- Global Discord Game SDK
- Steam alternative so good people will refer Steam as an alternative

GPG Key: I wish I had one

Generally you can find me on many places with my full name Akira Taguchi.

I also have a GitHub Sponsors page, but you are honestly much better off sponsoring other people working on great software projects.
